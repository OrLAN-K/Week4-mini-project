# ### Project 1: Task Manager

# In[ ]:


"""
Problem: You're working for an online marketplace. Users often search for products using keywords. Given 
a list of product names and their corresponding IDs, design a function that allows users to input a keyword 
and quickly find the product they are looking for. Implement a linear search algorithm to search for the 
keyword in the list of product names and return the corresponding product ID
- Display whether the target item was found or not in the list. 
- Return a closing/welcome message
- Apply object-oriented programming principles to design classes for tasks and users.
- Practice working with data structures like lists and dictionaries for task management.
- Implement decorators to add additional functionality to tasks.
- Gain experience in implementing a command-line application with functions and classes.

# ### Project 2: Movie recommender system

# In[ ]:


"""
Problem: Build a movie recommendation system that suggests movies to users based on their preferences. 
Create a class-based system where each user can rate movies. Use a dictionary to store movie ratings, and 
implement a recommendation algorithm that suggests movies similar to those the user has liked. The 
program should allow users to:
i. Add new movies to the system.
ii. Rate movies on a scale of 1 to 5.
iii. Get recommendations based on the user's 
highest-rated movies using a 
recommendation decorator.
Implement a function to find movies with the highest and lowest average ratings
- Display recommended movies based on userâ€™s highly-rated movies
- Show average ratings for movies
- Display movies with the highest & lowest ratings
- Design and implement classes for movies and users to manage data effectively.
- Practice working with dictionaries and lists to store and organize movie ratings.
- Apply lambda expressions and list comprehension for filtering and processing movie data.
- Gain experience in creating a recommendation system based on user preferences
